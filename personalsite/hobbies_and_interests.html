                <h2>Music</h2>
                <p>I participated in choir during all 4 years of high school, and for 2 semesters at BYU-Idaho. I have taken a class of basic piano. I just love music. I love listening to it, I love playing it, and I love singing along.</p>

                <h2>Traveling</h2>
                <p>I love going on trips and traveling to new places! I have been to Disneyland more times than I can count since I live in Southern California. I traveled to Japan when I was in High School. I have been to Catalina Island, and the channel Islands. I love river rafting. I have also done a fair-amount of hiking, but that's not my favorite even though I enjoy the views.</p>

                <h2>Disneyland</h2>
                <p>I don't consider myself an enthusiast. However, I did feel it necessary to dedicate an entire category to Disneyland purely because of how many much I've gone there. As a resident of Orange County, California, Disneyland is always just around the corner. It is so much fun to go as a family after school. I especially enjoy the gloomy, drizzly days since the park is less crowded.</p>
