                <h2>Future Career</h2>
                <p>I love stories. I love to laugh. I love reading. I also really like videogames with a good story. Since I am majoring in computer science, I would ultimately like to end up in a career related to computers. But more than that, I'd like to use these skills I'm learning to design videogames with amazing stories, or something along those lines. Graphic animation or CGI for movies isn't off the table. All in all, I just want to have a positive impact on people.</p>
