      <p>
        I love going on trips and traveling to new places! I have been to Disneyland more times than I can count since I live in Southern California. I traveled to Japan when I was in High School. I have been to Catalina Island, and the channel Islands. I love river rafting. I have also done a fair-amount of hiking, but that's not my favorite even though I enjoy the views.
