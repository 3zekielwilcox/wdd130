    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>Throughout the history of humanity, people of all ages have enjoyed witnessing the beauty of the earth, exploring, and getting their adrenaline pumping with a hint of danger and reward. The purpose of this website is to convince the viewer why, how, when, and where they should go white water rafting. Our goal as a company is to bring people together. Families, friends, and strangers can witnes the beauty of the earth and work together to overcome obstacles while having fun.</p>

    <h3>Audience</h3>
    <p>Here's the why: white water rafting is one of the most amazing experiences that just about anyone can have in their lifetime! Whether they be a couple on a day-date, a group of young boys, or even someone having a scenic time by themselves, white water rafting is the "once in a lifetime" experience you can have over and over again. The best part is that no trip is ever the same as the last. Rafting down the same river is a whole new experience every time! Different seasons can make the journey like an entire new world, and sharing the experience with new people can give a twist to any experience. Not to mention, the course of a river is constantly changing and creating new possibilities for fun, so even just a few years difference can completely change the journey.</p>
